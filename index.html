                    <p>
                        <span class="purple">Fantasy Jump</span> is a prototype game made by <a href="https://github.com/GlennFolker">Glenn</a>
                        in participation of a school literary project. It is a simple video game featuring a <span class="blue">blue
                        jumper ball</span>, several floating <span class="pink">spike balls</span>, and the <span class="purple">"Leaks."</span>
                        
                        The artwork is mostly 2D. Sprites are rendered 3 times bigger, making it having the pixel-y effect. Controls are mostly
                        using mouse, with keyboard keys just used to either exit the game or toggle fullscreen.
                        
                        The game itself is done in 30 days. You can download the Windows x64 release

                    <p>
                        You play as the <span class="blue">blue jumper ball</span>. Maneuver carefully among the <span class="pink">spike ball</span>
                        colony, or go full speed as you hunt down <span class="purple">Leaks</span>. You release propulsion to move, either with
                        strong or weak force depending on your mouse-hold duration.
                        
                        
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Your main objective is to terminate all 3 <span class="purple">Leaks</span>; yellowish-purple swirling black hole looking
                        things with extensive contact damage and health. Don't hit these things with your body! <span class="purple">Leaks</span>
                        shoot smaller sentient bullets which also shoot you with high velocity damaging lasers.

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://github.com/GlennFolker/FantasyJump">FantasyJump</a> v1.0.0 is written in <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">
                        C++</a>, compiled and linked with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17">Standard C++ 17</a> libraries, and using
                        <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> as the graphics manager. As for the external libraries, I used:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW</a> for wrangling newer OpenGL features to be used with OpenGL 3.0.0.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/g-truc/glm">GLM</a> for fast inlined mathematics around OpenGL functions.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a> as the main framework.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/">SDL2_image</a> for reading image files and turn them into in-memory pixel maps.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">SDL2_mixer</a> for playing the audio chunks; in this case I used Vorbis to load the audios.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://xiph.org/vorbis/">Vorbis</a> for reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">OGG</a> audio files and turn them into in-memory playable audio chunks.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt">EnTT</a> as the main library for managing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> as the main 2-dimensional physics engine.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        You can hypothetically use any C/CXX compiler to build this project, since I used <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> as
                        the building toolchain here. I highly recommend using <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">MinGW</a> for developers on Windows though.
